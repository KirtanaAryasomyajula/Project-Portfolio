1)  Medical Insurance Cost Analysis (Python-Linear Regression)

This project focused on predicting individual medical insurance costs based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. I cleaned and transformed the data using encoding techniques for categorical features and applied scaling to numerical variables. Exploratory data analysis revealed that smoking status and BMI had strong correlations with insurance charges. I built and evaluated several regression models, with Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor delivering high accuracy in predicting costs. The project emphasized practical feature engineering and regression evaluation metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE) to inform cost estimation strategies for healthcare providers and insurers.


2)  Drug type Classification using Logistic Regression

In this classification project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the type of drug prescribed to a patient based on medical indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium/potassium concentrations. After preprocessing the data (including label encoding and standardization), I explored feature relationships through visualizations and correlation heatmaps. I trained and compared multiple classifiers including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree Classifier achieved strong performance with high interpretability, allowing clear insight into how physiological factors influence drug type selection. This project highlights the intersection of healthcare and data science for improving prescription decisions.



3) Employee Evaluation For Promotion-Employee Promotion Prediction Using ML 

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict employee promotions using structured employee data. The dataset included attributes such as education level, department, training scores, previous year ratings, and award recognition. I performed comprehensive pre processing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying robust scaling to manage outliers. Through exploratory data analysis, I identified key features influencing promotion decisions. Among the models tested, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, outperforming a Decision Tree classifier (86%). The project demonstrated not only strong predictive performance but also interpretability and practical insights into HR decision-making.
