1)  Medical Insurance Cost Analysis (Python-Linear Regression)    |  Regression 

This project focused on predicting individual medical insurance costs based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. I cleaned and transformed the data using encoding techniques for categorical features and applied scaling to numerical variables. Exploratory data analysis revealed that smoking status and BMI had strong correlations with insurance charges. I built and evaluated several regression models, with Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor delivering high accuracy in predicting costs. The project emphasized practical feature engineering and regression evaluation metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) to inform cost estimation strategies for healthcare providers and insurers.


2)  Drug type Classification using Logistic Regression             |  Classification

In this classification project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the type of drug prescribed to a patient based on medical indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium/potassium concentrations. After preprocessing the data (including label encoding and standardization), I explored feature relationships through visualizations and correlation heatmaps. I trained and compared multiple classifiers including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree Classifier achieved strong performance with high interpretability, allowing clear insight into how physiological factors influence drug type selection. This project highlights the intersection of healthcare and data science for improving prescription decisions.



3) Employee Evaluation For Promotion-Employee Promotion Prediction Using ML     |  Classification

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict employee promotions using structured employee data. The dataset included attributes such as education level, department, training scores, previous year ratings, and award recognition. I performed comprehensive pre processing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying robust scaling to manage outliers. Through exploratory data analysis, I identified key features influencing promotion decisions. Among the models tested, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, outperforming a Decision Tree classifier (86%). The project demonstrated not only strong predictive performance but also interpretability and practical insights into HR decision-making.


4) Mobile Price Prediction Using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor    | Regression

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict price of mobile phone  based on medical indicators such as sales ,weight, resolution, internal memory and ram, battery and others. After pre processing the data I explored feature relationships through visualizations like pie charts, histplot, scatterplots and correlation heat maps. I trained and compared two models -Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor  performed well  compared to linear regression, allowing clear insight into how physiological factors influence drug type selection. This project highlights the prediction of mobile price ,through a small dataset,  which can be applied to a larger data for real time decision making.

5) E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction        |    Classification

   In this classification project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the chances of churn of customers for an e-commerce platform based on churn indicators such as satisfaction score, complains, warehouse to home distance, marital status ,etc.After pre processing the data (including label encoding and feature scaling), I explored feature relationships through visualizations like countplots, pie charts,histplots and correlation heatmaps. I trained and compared two classifiers including Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree Classifier achieved strong performance with high interpretability, allowing clear insight into how  factors  like complains and ratings influence  customer churn . This project highlights the intersection of e-commerce and data science for improving the e-commerce platform  service towards customers.


6) Concrete Strength Prediction based on Composition of various materials   |   Regression and RandomForest

   In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on material composition and curing time. The dataset included features such as cement, water, blast furnace slag, fly ash, aggregates, superplasticizer, and age. I performed thorough preprocessing steps including correlation analysis, feature scaling , and feature importance evaluation. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped uncover key relationships between features and strength. Among various models tested, the Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest performance with an R² score of 0.89, clearly identifying Age, Cement, and Water as critical inputs. The project demonstrates the potential of ML to improve quality control in the construction industry by accurately estimating concrete strength based on its composition.

7) Civil Engineering Project Engineer Evaluation |  Classification

   In this project, I built machine learning models to classify civil engineers as high-performing or needing improvement, based on a dataset from GlobalInfra Corp containing over 1 million project records. The dataset included engineer- and project-level features such as certificates, years of experience, salary bracket, overtime hours, project cost, proximity, and safety risk score.

I began with extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal feature relationships and detect multicollinearity. Correlation analysis highlighted dependencies between project cost, experience, and certifications. Feature engineering  techniques were applied to handle categorical data and prepare it for modeling.

Various classification models were tested, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The Logistic Regression model  delivered the most reliable results, identifying key drivers of engineer performance such as Salary Bracket, Years of Experience, and PCAB Score. This project underscores the potential of ML in human resource and operational decision-making in the civil engineering domain.
